Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form.

  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
      Yes
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
      Strengths:
      - Good collaboration
      - Ease of understanding each other's code
      - Speed
      Weaknesses:
      - More meetings (maybe) could have helped.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events; 
      Working together is fun!
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and 
      More meetings
